- Gillego-Flores Dental Clinic began operations on July 15, 2020. Nevertheless, from 2004 to 2012, my clinic was managed by Centro Medico at Riverbanks Mall. Owing to Riverbanks' rising occupancy rates, our clinic opted to relocate to Benhel Building, a facility diagonally across Riverbanks along Andres Bonifacio Avenue, and was recognized as Clinica Marikina from 2012 until 2020. A unexpected change in the management of the abovementioned clinic, along with the non-renovation of the property, prompted me to search for a better location and decided to launch my own clinic. Fortunately, the newly constructed building next to Barangka Elementary School was quite convenient given that the majority of my patients live in the region and are easily accessible.
