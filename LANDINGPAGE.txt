- Gillego-Flores Dental Clinic began operations on July 15, 2020. Nevertheless, from 2004 to 2012, my clinic was managed by Centro Medico at Riverbanks Mall. Owing to Riverbanks' rising occupancy rates, our clinic opted to relocate to Benhel Building, a facility diagonally across Riverbanks along Andres Bonifacio Avenue, and was recognized as Clinica Marikina from 2012 until 2020. A unexpected change in the management of the abovementioned clinic, along with the non-renovation of the property, prompted me to search for a better location and decided to launch my own clinic. Fortunately, the newly constructed building next to Barangka Elementary School was quite convenient given that the majority of my patients live in the region and are easily accessible.

DENTAL CROWNS

A crown is a full-coverage restoration that is glued onto the crown section of your existing tooth. Therefore, in order for the dental crown to fit over the existing tooth, it must first be prepped or trimmed. The dentist next takes a clear and succinct model of the prepared tooth or teeth before shipping them to the laboratory for real crown manufacturing.

This method is appropriate for severely damaged and decaying teeth where a dental filling may not be sufficient to strengthen and preserve the tooth's aim of effective restoration. Because root canal treated teeth are fragile and can break if not properly repaired, dental crowns are the ultimate treatment.

Moreover, a dental crown can be used to improve the size, look, and color of teeth that are fractured, abraded, discolored, stained, malposed, or misshaped.

Dental crowns can be made from a variety of materials. Our dentists will advise you on the appropriate material for your particular condition.
